# lan-chat
A locally hosted server that allows users to connect and chat with one another.

LAN chat was created with the desire to brush-up on Flask and learn more about using Sockets. The program itself is nothing too complicated as it only allows users to communicate with each other over a local area network. It does this through the use of Python-Flask as a backend, Jinja2 for templating, bootstrap5 for styling, Sockets for emitting messages to the server, and a database connector that follows the CRUD methodology.

## Project Scope

### Goal
To create a project that uses 'rgb(A,G,B)'flask'rgb(9,105,218)' and 'rgb(A,G,B)'sockets'rgb(9,105,218)' to dynamically manipulate data in a web application.

### Deliverables
A web app project that can be run locally and will include a chat feature as well as a login page, chat page that dynamically updates, history page, and logout link. There is no deadline on this project and it can be altered in the future.

### Project Acceptance
A review of the code to verify everything works as intended with as few errors as possible.

### Project Exclusions
n/a

### Project Constraints
1. Limimted time to allocate to project
2. Technical difficulties
3. Lack of a team
4. No user authentication (project won't implement)

## To whom it may concern
Thank you if you're reading this. This README was a way of practicing my ability to properly define a project scope for a project. The project you see here was uploaded AFTER it was completed. I expect to make changes and improvements to it as I'm still interested in trying to add a few features such as multiple chat rooms and actual user authentication.
